# Coral NPU

Coral NPU is a hardware accelerator for ML inferencing. Coral NPU is an Open
Source IP designed by Google Research and is freely available for integration
into ultra-low-power System-on-Chips (SoCs) targeting wearable devices such as
hearables, augmented reality (AR) glasses and smart watches.

Coral NPU is a neural processing unit (NPU), also known as an AI accelerator or
deep-learning processor. Coral NPU is based on the 32-bit RISC-V Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA).

Coral NPU includes three distinct processor components that work together:
matrix, vector (SIMD), and scalar.

## Coral NPU Features

Coral NPU offers the following top-level feature set:

* RV32IMF_Zve32x RISC-V instruction set (specifically `rv32imf_zve32x_zicsr_zifencei_zbb`)
* 32-bit address space for applications and operating system kernels
* Four-stage processor, in-order dispatch, out-of-order retire
* Four-way scalar, two-way vector dispatch
* 128-bit SIMD, 256-bit (future) pipeline
* 8 KB ITCM memory (tightly-coupled memory for instructions)
* 32 KB DTCM memory (tightly-coupled memory for data)
* Both memories are single-cycle-latency SRAM, more efficient than cache memory
* AXI4 bus interfaces, functioning as both manager and subordinate, to interact
  with external memory and allow external CPUs to configure Coral NPU

## System Requirements

* Bazel 8.6.0
* Python 3.9-3.13

See [coralnpu.dockerfile](utils/coralnpu.dockerfile) for a detailed list of
requirements.  Our CI systems run most builds and tests using this image.

## Verification & Testing

For details on our testing methodologies and how to run or write tests, see the
corresponding test READMEs:

* [Cocotb Tests (RTL & Netlist simulation)](tests/cocotb/README.md)
* [UVM Testbench (Co-simulation)](tests/uvm/README.md)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Ensure that test suite passes
bazel run //tests/cocotb:core_mini_axi_sim_cocotb

# Build a binary
bazel build //examples:coralnpu_v2_hello_world_add_floats

# Build the Simulator (non-RVV for shorter build time):
bazel build //tests/verilator_sim:core_mini_axi_sim

# Run the binary on the simulator:
bazel-bin/tests/verilator_sim/core_mini_axi_sim --binary bazel-out/k8-fastbuild-ST-dd8dc713f32d/bin/examples/coralnpu_v2_hello_world_add_floats.elf
```

## Learn by building it yourself (教学仓)

This repository also ships a guided course that takes you from an empty file to a
working NPU, using the RTL in this repository as the reference answer:

```bash
./learn doctor     # check the toolchain (Python, iverilog, RISC-V GCC)
./learn list       # ten stages: L00 .. L10
./learn start L00  # course material for the first stage
./learn check L01  # run the auto-checker against your own RTL
```

Ten stages: RV32I single-cycle core → load/store subsystem → pipeline and hazards
→ AXI shell and boot → floating point → RVV vector core → Zvt matrix engine →
buses, peripherals and DMA → software stack and models → verification and capstone.

Each stage ships two PDFs (concepts, homework), a starter RTL file with TODOs, and a
checker that diffs your RTL against a Python golden model instruction by instruction.
Course material is written in Chinese. See [course/README.md](course/README.md) and
[course/ROADMAP.md](course/ROADMAP.md).
